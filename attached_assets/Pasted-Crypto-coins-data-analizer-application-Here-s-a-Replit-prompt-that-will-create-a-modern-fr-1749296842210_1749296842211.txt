Crypto coins data analizer application


Hereâ€™s a **Replit prompt** that will create a modern, frontend-only **TypeScript-based UI** app using **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** to display crypto analysis by consuming your existing local API (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze`). It allows users to input trading pairs and shows a clear, organized analysis result in a modern design â€” **no backend included**.

### âœ… Replit Prompt (copy-paste this in Replit)

> **Prompt to Replit:**

```
Create a modern frontend-only crypto analysis dashboard using **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**. No backend should be included.

**Features to include:**
- Input field to enter crypto pair (e.g., I-USDT_INR)
- Button to trigger API request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze`
- Display analysis data returned from API in clean, card-based sections:
  - Candles Analysis
  - Order Book Analysis
  - Trade History Analysis
  - Suggested Trading Recipe
- Show `risk_level`, `buy_or_not`, `expected_profit`, `suggested_price_per_unit` in a highlighted box
- Display error messages gracefully if fetch fails
- Responsive UI with a modern design

**Constraints:**
- Use only TypeScript (no JavaScript files)
- Use only React + Tailwind CSS + Fetch API
- Do not include a backend/server
- Structure the project using `vite` template

The UI should look clean and professional with Tailwind's card-style layout, using consistent spacing, colors, and responsiveness.
```

### ðŸ§  How It Works

* **Frontend-only**: It fetches from your Flask server at `localhost:5000`.
* **Custom Pair Input**: The user can test with different crypto pairs.
* **Tailwind UI**: Clean cards, responsive layout, and readable typography.
* **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and modern frontend stack.

### âœ… After Replit Generates the Template:

Youâ€™ll likely see files like:

```
src/
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
  components/
    PairInput.tsx
    ResultCard.tsx
    ErrorAlert.tsx
  types.ts
```

If you need I can generate and paste the full `App.tsx` and components code too.

API Details use


var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
  "pair": "'I-USDT_INR'"
});

var requestOptions = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: myHeaders,
  body: raw,
  redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze", requestOptions)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log('error', error));


  Sample response :

  {
    "analysis": {
        "candles_analysis": "Okay, I need the candle data for 'I-USDT_INR' at 1m to perform that analysis.  Please provide the list of candles (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for each minute.  Once you provide the data, I'll give you a concise summary of the analysis.\n",
        "order_book_analysis": "*   **Best Bid/Ask:** No bids or asks available.\n*   **Spread:** Undefined (cannot calculate without bid/ask data).\n*   **Order Book Imbalance:** Cannot determine imbalance.\n*   **Liquidity Walls:** None present.\n*   **Spoofing/Layering:** Cannot detect.\n*   **Volume Clusters:** None.\n*   **Microstructure Trend:** Neutral, no trend detectable.\n*   **Momentum:** No momentum discernible.\n*   **Trend/Price Action Indication:** The order book is empty, indicating extremely low or no current trading activity.

        "trade_history_analysis": "**Given the empty trade history, I can't provide specific insights. Here's a general framework if data was available:**\n\n*   **ðŸ“ˆ Price Action/Momentum:** Look for trends (uptrend, downtrend, sideways), volatility, and recent direction.\n*   **ðŸ”„ Buy/Sell Pressure:** Analyze volume associated with buys vs. sells to gauge dominant sentiment. Look for large orders influencing direction.\n*   **ðŸ’¡ Trade Signals:** Use patterns and pressure to identify potential buy (support, breakout) or sell (resistance, breakdown) opportunities.\n*   **ðŸŽ¯ Levels:** Entry near support/resistance, limit at next price target, stop-loss below support/above resistance.\n"
